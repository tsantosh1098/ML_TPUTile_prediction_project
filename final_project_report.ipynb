    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> In this project, we use the TPUGraphs dataset, titled \"A Performance Prediction Dataset on Large Tensor Computational Graphs,\" recently published by Google (August 25, 2023). Our objective is to predict the <b>K-Top tiles for a given computational graph and compilation configuration</b> using this dataset. Specifically, we aim to understand the relationship between the computational graph and the compilation configuration for a provided neural network model. Our goal is to model a cost function that predicts the K-Top tiles, enabling the compilation configuration to achieve optimal performance. </div>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> In our pursuit of understanding this relationship, we initiated the project with a focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs offer a unique opportunity to contribute to a rapidly evolving field with broad applications, posing open research challenges and the potential to make a significant impact across various industries and domains. The combination of theoretical advances and practical relevance makes GNNs an attractive area for both research and development. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> We started our work based on the foundational program provided by the Google TPUGraphs team. The repository includes three baseline models utilizing TensorFlow-2 and TF-GNN: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model and two GNNs (GraphSAGE and GCN with residual connections). The MLP model embeds all opcodes, concatenates them with node features, sums across all nodes, and further concatenates them with kernel configuration features, feeding into a 3-layer MLP. The combination of graph-level features with node-level information can be accomplished through either late-join or early-join. The former runs the GNN solely on node features, reduces the node embeddings, and concatenates them with the graph (configuration) features. Consequently, multiple configurations over the same graph share the forward and backward pass. The latter replicates the graph features onto every node, grouping configurations per graph, and executing sparse-ops only once per graph (on cube-tensors rather than matrices). The early-join GraphSAGE model closely resembles the original TPU learned cost model [Kaufman, Samuel, 2021].  </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> Once playing with the TPUGraph team provided code base, we thought of developing our own codebase to train the model and experiment the things out. We used PyTorch framework to implement our model. We used PyTorch <b>Geometric</b> package to use GNN Convolution layers and other supporting layers. Other then this, out of the box we have also tried learning the data using transforms. We employed transforms, particularly the BertGraphEncoder, to learn the relationships within graphs. These transformers are advanced and incorporate self-attention layers, aiming to capture more general context and prevent overfitting on the training dataset. Further details about the algorithms used and experiments are explained in detail in the methodology section. </div>"

It ensures that when using multiple GPUs, data downloading and manipulations are performed only once to avoid duplication. It also abstracts away details to make code cleaner and prevents issues related to multiple GPUs executing the same code. when it comes to optimier Lightning provides the <span style=\"color: red;\">configure_optimizers</span> function to handle optimizer setup. It allows easy selection of optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam) and configuration. It extends to enable support for multiple optimizers, such as those used in GANs. In loss function, there is no such visible change has been seen. The real beauty of using the lighting is in trainer function. In standard PyTorch, users manually write the training loop, which might introduce the potential errors. Lightning abstracts away the boilerplate code associated with training loops, making code cleaner and less error-prone. It's capable of handling complexities like multiple GPUs, gradient clipping, early stopping, checkpointing, TPU training, and 16-bit precision. It mostly abstracts away the details of training, allowing users to focus on high-level model logic. This makes training process organized, making it easier to read, understand, and debug. </div>"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> After training the model using GNNs and conducting multiple experiments, we achieved an accuracy of 94.6%. This accuracy emphasizes the effectiveness of our GNNConv/GraphSAGE-based approach in capturing intricate dependencies within graph-structured data. In our case, the validation accuracy serves as a reliable metric, showcasing the model's proficiency in generalizing to unseen data and making precise predictions. Additionally, in the Model section (1.3.4), we have detailed the experiments conducted with hyperparameters, including relevant tables. Additionally, we have attached some of the training and testing plots generated using TensorBoard.

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> As seen from the above experiments, the accuracy obtained ranged from 92% to 95%. Despite conducting numerous experiments on hyperparameters and altering model layers, further improvements in accuracy were not observed. Consequently, we thought of exploring alternate approaches to increase the model accuracy. Given that this project is an ongoing Kaggle project, we turned to the Kaggle website's discussion forum and code section to get some more insights. In this forum, we discovered that some of them were incorporating BERT for model learning. Since the BERT backbone utilizes transformers and they possesses self-attention capabilities, this model may be more capable of capturing relationships between the computational graph and compilation configuration. Referencing code from the Kaggle code section, we started our experiments on the bertencoder model. However, the real challenge was in understanding the complexity of the code, particularly in understanding the transformers part within the BERT encoder. Within a short span of time, we attempted to grasp the fundamental aspects of the program and successfully executed the base code. However, we are still lagging behind in conducting hyperparameter-based experiments and updating the code with evaluation metrics. </div>\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> As part of our future work, we intend to utilize a transformer-based model and experiment to enhance accuracy. Additionally, as mentioned in the introduction section, for this project, our focus has been solely on tile-based data. However, incorporating layout-based data and training the model to suggest the optimal graph configuration on hardware, specifically TPU, poses a more complexity and learning this will be more adventures.  </div>"

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify; text-indent: 4em;\"> In this project, we aimed to learn and understand the relationship between computational graphs and compilation configurations using the TPUGraphs dataset. The primary goal was to predict the K-Top tiles for a given computational graph. We chose Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a learning model. We anticipated that implementing GNNs, specifically GraphSAGE, would be important, and optimizing hyperparameters would be a challenging yet essential task. Throughout the project, we implemented and experimented with GNNs, achieving an accuracy of 94.6%. The utilization of GraphSAGE for understanding intricate dependencies within the graph-structured data proved effective. We learned how to handle and preprocess the TPUGraphs dataset, with a focus on the Tile collection. The integration of PyTorch Lightning streamlined our training process, providing scalability and simplifying complex training loops. The project emphasized the significance of hyperparameter tuning, especially in dimensions like opcode embedding size, hidden channel dimensions, and MLP architecture. Transition to BERT Encoder, exploring the use of a transformer-based model, specifically BERT encoder, presented difficulties in understanding the complex code and adapting it to the project's context. Since the project is part of an ongoing Kaggle competition, the lack of ground truth labels for the test dataset posed challenges in evaluating the accuracy of the model. </div>"
